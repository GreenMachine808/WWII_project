		<h4> 
			The American fleet in the Battle of Midway was very limited. We only had 3 aircraft carriers. The Yorktown had just come out of the Battle of Coral Sea near austrailia and the Hornet had just returned (unharmed) from the Doolittle raid. The other aircraft carrier, the Enterpirse (no jokes please), was perfectly fine.

	<h4>
		The Japanese fleet out numbered us almost 2-1. They had four aircraft carriers named Kaga, Akagi, Soryu, and the Hiryu. They also had battleships. We had none, because the bombing of pearl harbor destroyed most of our navy.
