			The Attack: American tactics 
		</h2>	
	
		<h3>
			When our bombers were attacking the Japanese aircraft carriers, our piliots developed a very funny tactic. Piliots told each other "Aim for the big red circle!". On the Japanese aircraft carriers, there was a design flaw. They painted the Hinomaru (rising sun) on the runway. This was a easy target for our aircraft to hit.
